Looking to host it THIS Friday (09.01.2025), 8am pst.\nGGG Will be funding slots so no need to worry about crowdfunding. For players who aren't sure what a private league is. It's essentially an Economy Reset of the league we just played. In this instance Keepers of the Flame. You can also trade just like normal and even setup your Awakened PoE Trade to the private league. Think of it as a miniature PoE1 League but with nothing new.",
